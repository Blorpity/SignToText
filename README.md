# SignToText

**SignToText** is an application that translates **American Sign Language (ASL)** gestures into text in real time.  
The translated text is written to a `.txt` file for further use or integration.  
Currently, the project focuses on recognizing **ASL alphabet gestures**, with plans to expand to full word and phrase detection.
An option to run the application as a browser extension will also be added.

---

## 🚀 Overview

SignToText uses **computer vision** and **machine learning** to interpret hand gestures captured through a live camera feed.  
By leveraging **TensorFlow**, **OpenCV**, and **MediaPipe**, the system detects hand landmarks, interprets gestures, and outputs corresponding text.

## 🧠 Tech Stack

- **Python**
- **TensorFlow**
- **OpenCV**
- **MediaPipe**
- **NumPy**

## ⚙️ Setup & Installation

> **Note:** Setup instructions are currently **TBD**.  
> This section will be updated as the project matures and installation requirements are finalized.

---

## 🎯 Usage

1. Run the application.  
2. Allow access to your system camera.  
3. Perform ASL gestures in front of the camera.  
4. The recognized letter will be:
   - Displayed in a defined text bar
   - Saved to a `.txt` file for output.
