# SignToText
# Built in VS Code

# Uses browser extensions

# What does it do?: Browser Extension for ASL users to have a "sign-to-text" feature for writing on google docs. We are beginning with support for the ASL alphabet

# Why is it useful?: Removes long hours of sitting at a desk and typing away, now you can sign into your computer's camera and it'll read your signs!
